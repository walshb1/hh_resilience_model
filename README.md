# hh_resilience_model
This is a repository of code for the socioeconomic resilience model

This readme is intended to help TTLs, policy-makers, and researchers apply the socioeconomic resilience methodology to their context. The main innovation of the analysis is the introduction of wellbeing losses as a metric of disaster impacts, to complement traditional approaches based on asset losses. 

By themselves, asset losses are not an appropriate metric of disaster impacts on households. Specificlly, asset losses underestimate disaster impacts on the poor, because they by definition have the least to lose. Therefore, disaster risk management (DRM) strategies designed to minimize asset losses can (at best) ignore DRM/poverty reduction co-benefits or (at worst) fail to protect the interests of the poor.

Wellbeing losses correct for this bias in part by calculating consumption losses, accounting for financial inclusion, precautionary savings, and public receipt differentials across the income distribution. Wellbeing losses are calculated from household consumption losses, reweighted according to the marginal utility of consumption for disaster-affected households.

This code repository represents a complex and ambitious modeling exercise, but even given limited data (eg. exposure, vulnerability, representativeness, response), DRM strategies that seek to minimize wellbeing losses generate insights into the vicious relationship between chronic poverty and natural disasters. 

Further, wellbeing losses expand (by merging) the traditionally separate DRM and poverty-reduction toolboxes. The socio-economic resilience methodology measures the DRM benefits of interventions that don't affect asset losses (e.g., post-disaster support, financial inclusion, timeliness vs. accuracy of aid) AND the anti-poverty benefits of retrofitting, land-use planning, and civil engineering. This approach to disaster risk management helps to understand and manage geographical and socio-economic heterogeneity in disaster risk at the admin-1 or admin-2 level.
